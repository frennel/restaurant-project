	Pasto Felice Restaurant was founded in 2008 by just a small family of chefs situated in Smallville Complex, Iloilo City. The idea of putting up a restaurant was started when a newly-graduated of culinary arts wants to build a restaurant of her own. She was the eldest of her family. Together with her brother and sister-in-law, they planned together on how to make their dream a reality. At first, because of financial problems, they almost gave up on their plan of building their own restaurant. Eventually, they decided to use the money their parents had bestowed upon them. They used up their heritage given to them by their late father who was a seafarer back in the 90&#39s. They use up their money on building the restaurant. Fortunately, because of their cooking skills and a lot of teamwork, they built a fully-running restaurant which has a simple yet cozy environment that customers can&#39t get enough of. As of 2014, the Pasto Felice Restaurant currently serve 100 customers a week.<br><br>
